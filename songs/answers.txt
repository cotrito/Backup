If songs.db contains the top 100 songs of one listener from 2018, how would you characterize their audio aura?
energy = 0.65
valence = 0.48
danceability = 0.71

Hypothesize about why the way youâ€™ve calculated this aura might not be very representative of the listener. What better ways of calculating this aura would you propose?
by looking in the genres of the music he has lisen in the past year
